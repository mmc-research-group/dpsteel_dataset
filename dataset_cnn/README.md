## Stress_strain
The maximum stresses and the working limit strains based on the deslication-crystal plasticity finite element method

Each row corresponds to mechanical properties for each microstructure.  
The breakdown of the data in a certain row is as follows:  

Row 0: fraction of martensite  
Row 1: maximum stress(x-tensile)  
Row 2: working limit strain(x-tensile)  
Row 3: maximum stress(y-tensile)  
Row 4: working limit strain(y-tensile)  
Row 5: maximum stress(x-shear)  
Row 6: working limit strain(x-shear)  
Row 7: maximum stress(y-shear)  
Row 8: working limit strain(y-shear)
